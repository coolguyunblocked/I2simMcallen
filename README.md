The forecast is approximately a minute long and provides information on current and forecasted weather conditions. This type of forecast started in 1982 using WeatherStar units. It was later upgraded to the Intellistar 1 in 2003 and recieved various graphic changes over the years. The intellistar 2 had replaced the Intellistar 1 by 2015. This emulator uses the style that started in 2019.
